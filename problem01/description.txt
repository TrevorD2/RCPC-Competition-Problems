Problem:
Samantha is going to the metal cube store, as one does, to buy a tungsten cubes. 
She wants to know the weight of the cubes, but can't pick them up due to her weak nerd arms.
Instead, she measures the size of the cubes to try and find out how heavy they are.

Given the side length of a tungsten cube, return the mass in kilograms of the cube, truncated (rounded down) to the nearest kilogram.
(Use a density of 19.254 g/cmÂ³ for tungsten)

Input:

side_length: integer

Constraints:

1 <= side_length <= 1000

Output:

mass: integer
