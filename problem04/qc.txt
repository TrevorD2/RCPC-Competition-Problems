#Please use consistent variable names between descirption and solution (password vs ciphertext)
#Also im not sure if all use cases here will actually be 1:1
#ie. (7 * 5) % 10 == (5 * 5) % 10 == 5
#unless you wanna carefully curate values, might need to change the algorithm
#also also, why did u add P
#also also also, please use better formatting for your math operations and function def

(i*D)%11==1 should be (i*D) % 11 == 1

def mapping(integer:int)->int: should be def mapping(integer: int) -> int:
