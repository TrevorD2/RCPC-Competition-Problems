Name: Stablize Conway

Difficulty: Hard
Points: 9

Problem: 
You are given a grid of filled (*) and empty ( ) cells following the rules of conway's game of life (seen below)
Starting on generation 0, after how many generations will it take before the population stablizes?
A generation's population is stable when
1. All cells are in the same state as the last generation OR
2. All cells are looping through an oscillating pattern (this occurs when the current generation has the same arrangment of cells as a previous generation)

1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies - underpopulation
2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives - stable population
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies - underpopulation
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell - reproduction
5. Any cell born on the edge of the grid dies - cosmic correction


Input:
grid: string

Constraints:
0 <= grid <= 2500 chars
0 <= grid_width <= 50 chars
0 <= grid_height <= 50 chars

Output:
generation_count: integer
