Name: Stablize Conway

Difficulty: Hard

Problem: 
You are given a grid of filled (*) and empty ( ) cells following the rules of conway's game of life (seen below)
Starting on generation 0, after how many generations will it take before the population stablizes?
A population is stable when either all cells are in the same state as the last generation

1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies - underpopulation
2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives - stable population
3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies - underpopulation
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell - reproduction
5. Any cell born on the edge of the grid dies - cosmic correction


Input:
grid: str

Constraints:
0 <= grid <= 2500 chars
0 <= grid_length <= 50 chars
0 <= grid_height <= 50 chars

Output:
stable_generation: int
