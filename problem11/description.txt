Name: Mirror Mirror on the Funhouse Wall

Difficulty: Medium
Points: 5

Problem:
Aftering entering a house of mirrors, you stare into one of the many mirrors and see a fancy tophat.
To be the fanciest of them all, you need to get that tophat, but you don't know where it is in the house of mirrors.
Given your coordinate position in a string representing the funhouse, follow the path of the mirrors which redirect light at a 90 degree angle. Mirrors are represented by the / and \ characters.
Ex. When the light approaches from the left of \, it will be redirected downwards.
Once the path hits the edge of the funhouse (reaches the boundary of the string), you have found the tophat.

Input:
funhouse: list[string]
start_pos: [integer, integer]
start_direction: string

Constraints:
0 <= len(funhouse) <= 50
0 <= len(funhouse[i]) <= 50
0 <= start_pos[0] <= funhouse_length - 1
0 <= start_pos[1] <= funhouse_height - 1
start_direction in ["up", "down", "left", "right"]

Output:
tophat_pos: [integer, integer]
