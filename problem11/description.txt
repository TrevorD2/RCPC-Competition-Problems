Name: Mirror Mirror on the Funhouse Wall

Difficulty: Medium

Problem:
Aftering entering a house of mirrors, you ask the mirror you stare into one of the many mirrors and see a fancy tophat.
To be the fanciest of them all, you need to get that tophat, but you don't know where it is in the house of mirrors.
Given your coordinate position in a string representing the funhouse, follow the path of the mirrors which redirect light at a 90 degree angle. Mirrors are represented by the / and \ characters.
For example, when the light approaches from the left of \, it will be redirected downwards.

Input:
funhouse: string
start_pos: array[integer, integer]

Constraints:
0 <= string <= 2500 chars
0 <= funhouse_length <= 50 chars
0 <= funhouse_height <= 50 chars
0 <= start_pos[0] <= funhouse_length - 1
0 <= start_pos[1] <= funhouse_height - 1

Output:
tophat_pos: array[integer, integer]
