Name: Christmas Snow

Difficulty: Medium

Problem:
It's Christmas time and snow is falling, but where will it fall? Given a 2d side view of a landscape represented by a string, return the same landscape after the snow has fallen.
At the top of each column will be a number representing the amount of snow particles that will fall. 
A row of snow particles is released all at once, but wait for all particles to settle before releasing the next row.
Snow particles (represented by *) will fall straight down until they land on top of another non-empty character.
If a snow particle would land on a slash character (/ or \), then it will both fall and be pushed to the left or right, respectively.
Return the landscape with the numbers removed and the snow particles falling fully simulated.
