Name: Christmas Snow

Difficulty: Medium

Problem:
It's Christmas time and snow is falling. Given a 2d side view of a landscape represented by a string, return the same landscape after the snow has fallen.
At the top of each column will be a number representing the amount of snow particles that will fall.
Snow particles (represented by *) will fall straight down until they hit another non-empty character.
If a snow particle hits a slash character (/ or \), then it will be pushed to the right or left, according to the direction of the slash.


Input:
landscape: string

Constraints:
0 <= funhouse <= 2500 chars
0 <= funhouse_length <= 50 chars
0 <= funhouse_height <= 50 chars
0 <= snow_particles_per_column <= 10

Output:
snowy_landscape: string
