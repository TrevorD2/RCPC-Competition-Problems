Name: Santa's Long Drive

Difficulty: Medium

Problem:
Whilst delivering presents, Santa's sleigh has broken just before delivering presents to the final n houses! Instead of flying by sleigh, Santa must resort to driving a truck from house to house instead.
Santa wishes to only drive past a given house one time, as passing the house again might raise suspicion. Given a list of road connections, where the ith value (a, b) represents a bidirectional connection between house a and b, and the number of houses, n, return true if Santa can travel to each house exactly once or false otherwise.

Input:
roads: array[integer, integer]

Constraints:
0 < roads.length < 100
0 < n < 1000

Output:
possible: boolean
