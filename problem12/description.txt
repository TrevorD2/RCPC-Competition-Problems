Name: Squares

Difficulty: Medium

Problem:
Given an array of points, where the ith value is a tuple (x, y) representing the x and y position of the ith point, return the number of squares that can be formed with the given set of points.
A square is defined as four vertices with four congruent edges, with right angles between each of the adjacent edges.

Input:
vertices: array[integer, integer]

Constraints:
0 < vertices.length < 10,000

Output:
num_squares: integer
