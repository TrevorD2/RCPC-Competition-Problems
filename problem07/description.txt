Name: 404 Support Beams Not Found

Difficulty: Medium
Points: 4

Problem:
Six Flags is making a new roller coaster and wants to find out the total length of all the support beams needed.
Given a graph of #’s representing the roller coaster’s track, find out how many meters of support beams need to be placed if there needs to be support beams all the way from under the track (#) to the ground (-).
Note: the x-axis always has a scaling of 1, but the y-axis may be scaled (using an integer or float).

Input:
coaster: string

Constraints:
0 <= coaster <= 300 chars

Output:
beam_length: float
