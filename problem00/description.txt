Welcome to the first ever RHS Programming Competition! The hosts of the competition wish to welcome all participants by writing a program instead of physically interacting with them, as that would require social skills (which the hosts do not have).

Given the name of a participant, return the string "Hello PARTICIPANT, welcome to the RHS Programming Competition!" where "PARTICIPANT" is replaced with the name of the participant.
