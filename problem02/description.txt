Vector (from Despicable Me) has invented a new kind of math to aid his nefarious plots! He has invented a structure that he calls a "vector" which can be used for a variety of applications.
A vector is an array of n numbers, denoted as v = <x₀, x₁,. . ., xᵢ, . . .,xₙ>. Where xᵢ denotes a real number. Vector (the villain) has created a way to multiply vectors known as the "dot product" denoted with an asterisk (*).
The dot product of two vectors of size n, u and v, is the result of multiplying each of the vectors element-wise and adding the resulting n numbers. This operation can be written as Σuᵢvᵢ where uᵢ and vᵢ denote the ith value of u or v respectively. For example, if u=<1,2> and v=<3,4> the dot product would be (1)(3)+(2)(4)=11.
Despite this revolutionary theory, Vector can only calculate his dot products by hand, since he does not know anything about computer science. Defeat Vector by writing a program to automate the process of calculating the dot product between two vectors. 

Given two arrays of numbers, u and v, each containing n numbers, calculate and return the dot product of u and v.
