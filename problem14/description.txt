Name: Slippery Slopes

Difficulty: Medium

Problem:
[character] is skiing down a mountain, and wants to find the longest decreasing subsequence on his route. Given an array heights corresponding to the elevation of the mountain along [character]'s route, return the longest decreasing subsequence of heights. A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input:
heights: array[integer]

Constraints:
0 < heights.length < 1000
0 < heights[i].length < 1000

Output:
longest_subsequence: array[integer]
