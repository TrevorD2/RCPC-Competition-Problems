Problem:
Isaac is skiing down a mountain, and wants to find the longest decreasing subsequence on his route (he is a nerd). 
Given an array heights corresponding to the elevation of the mountain along Isaac's route, return the longest decreasing subsequence of heights. 
A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
In this case, a decreasing subsequence is a subsequence such that a[i] > a[j] for all (i, j) where i < j.

Input:
heights: array[integer]

Constraints:
0 < heights.length < 1000
0 < heights[i].length < 1000

Output:
longest_subsequence: array[integer]
