Name: The Imperial Recipe

Difficulty: Medium
Points: 4

Problem: 
Your friend from Germany just came to the U.S, and you want to teach him your favorite recipes.
However, he doesn't understand the imperial system of measurement (because it makes no sense).

Given a measurement, unit, and ingredient, return the converted version using the given format and conversions below.
Convert all imperial units to metric and round (not truncate) all conversions to 1 decimal place.
Metric units use the shortened names of either "mL" or "g".
Do not convert non-imperial units (ie. 1 pinch) to metric.

"{metric_measurement} {metric_unit} of {ingredient}"

1 ounce = 28.35 gram
1 fluid ounce = 29.57 milliliter

1 pound = 16 ounce
1 gallon = 128 fluid ounce
1 quart = 32 fluid ounce
1 pint = 16 fuild ounce
1 cup = 8 fluid ounce
1 tablespoon = 1/2 fluid ounce
1 teaspoon = 1/6 fluid ounce


Input:
measurement: float
unit: string
ingredient: string

Constraints:
0 <= measurement <= 10
0 <= unit <= 50 chars
0 <= ingredient <= 50 chars

Output:
